These scripts aim to provide a unified, simple way for package managers 
to add users and groups to the system when demanded by a package, and 
then to maintain them later on.

Right now they're not at all ready for use, but any feedback, test 
cases, etc would be very much appreciated.

An ebuild for this package can be found in my overlay.
